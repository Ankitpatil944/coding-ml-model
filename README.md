## üõ†Ô∏è Setup Instructions

### 1. Start the FastAPI Server

First, make sure your FastAPI server is running:

```bash
# In your FastAPI project directory
python your_fastapi_file.py
# or
uvicorn your_fastapi_file:app --reload
```

The FastAPI server should be running on `http://localhost:8000`

### 2. Start the UI Server

```bash
# In the UI directory
python server.py
```

The UI will be available at `http://localhost:3000`

### 3. Configure API URL (if needed)

If your FastAPI server is running on a different port or host, update the `API_BASE_URL` in `script.js`:

```javascript
const API_BASE_URL = 'http://your-server:your-port';
```
